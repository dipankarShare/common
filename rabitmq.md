## RabbitMQ
To use RabbitMQ as the message broker for Celery, you'll need to install and configure RabbitMQ on your system. Below is a step-by-step guide for installing RabbitMQ and running Celery with RabbitMQ as the broker.
###  Install RabbitMQ
- Install RabbitMQ on macOS, Linux, or Windows
```sh
brew install rabbitmq
```
- Ubuntu Linux
```sh
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install rabbitmq-server
```
- Windows: RabbitMQ provides an installer for Windows. Download and install it from the official RabbitMQ website. Follow the official installation doc.

### Start RabbitMQ Server
```sh
sudo systemctl start rabbitmq-server
```
### To enable it to start automatically on boot:
```sh
sudo systemctl enable rabbitmq-server
sudo systemctl status rabbitmq-server
```
Windows: After installation, RabbitMQ should automatically start. If not, you can start it manually by opening the command prompt and running:
```sh
rabbitmq-server.bat
```
### Enable the RabbitMQ Management Plugin (Optional but Recommended)
The RabbitMQ management plugin provides a nice web-based UI for monitoring and managing your RabbitMQ server. To enable it:
```sh
sudo rabbitmq-plugins enable rabbitmq_management
```
The RabbitMQ management UI will be available at http://localhost:15672/ (default login: guest/guest).

### Install pika (Python client for RabbitMQ):
```sh
pip install pika
```

### RabbitMQ in Docker
A quick and efficient way to run a RabbitMQ instance without needing to install it directly on your system. Docker provides a ready-made RabbitMQ image that you can pull and run with just a few commands.

Here’s how to set up RabbitMQ in a Docker container for use with Celery.
#### Install Docker
- Pull the RabbitMQ Docker Image
```sh
docker pull rabbitmq:management
```
- Run RabbitMQ in Docker

Now, you can run RabbitMQ in a Docker container using the docker run command. You can expose the necessary ports for the RabbitMQ service (default AMQP port is 5672 and the management web UI port is 15672).

Persistent RabbitMQ Data

By default, the RabbitMQ Docker container doesn’t persist data when the container is stopped or removed. If you want RabbitMQ to retain its data across container restarts, you can use Docker volumes.

Here’s an example of how to run RabbitMQ with a volume for persistence:
```sh
docker run -d --name rabbitmq -p 5672:5672 -p 15672:15672 -v rabbitmq-data:/var/lib/rabbitmq rabbitmq:management
```
In this case, -v rabbitmq-data:/var/lib/rabbitmq creates a named volume (rabbitmq-data) that will persist the RabbitMQ data across container restarts.

This command does the following:

    -d: Runs the container in detached mode (in the background).
    --name rabbitmq: Names the container rabbitmq.
    -p 5672:5672: Exposes the RabbitMQ AMQP port (used for communication between Celery and RabbitMQ).
    -p 15672:15672: Exposes the RabbitMQ management plugin web UI port.

- Verify RabbitMQ is Running

You can verify that the RabbitMQ container is running by listing all running containers:

docker ps

You should see output like this:
```shell
CONTAINER ID   IMAGE                    COMMAND                  CREATED         STATUS         PORTS                                                 NAMES
abc123xyz456   rabbitmq:management       "docker-entrypoint.s…"   5 seconds ago   Up 3 seconds   4369/tcp, 5672-5673/tcp, 15672/tcp                   rabbitmq
```
- Access RabbitMQ Management UI

You can access the RabbitMQ management console by opening your browser and going to:

http://localhost:15672

    Username: guest
    Password: guest

This will take you to the RabbitMQ web interface, where you can monitor queues, exchanges, and connections.

## Configure Celery to Use RabbitMQ
Now that RabbitMQ is running in Docker, you can configure Celery to use it as the broker. In your celery_app.py (or equivalent) file, set the broker URL to use RabbitMQ:
```sh
# celery_app.py
from celery import Celery

# Use RabbitMQ as the message broker (note that we're using the default 'guest' user)
app = Celery('tasks', broker='pyamqp://guest:guest@localhost//')

@app.task
def add(x, y):
    return x + y
```
### Start Celery Worker
Now, run the Celery worker to process the tasks. In a new terminal window or tab, run the following command to start the Celery worker:
```sh
celery -A celery_app worker --loglevel=info
```
This will start the Celery worker and it will begin processing tasks as they are sent to RabbitMQ.
### Send Tasks to RabbitMQ
Now, you can send tasks to the RabbitMQ queue. For example, in your main.py script, you can asynchronously call the Celery task:
```sh
# main.py
from celery_app import add

# Call the task asynchronously
result = add.apply_async((4, 6))

# Check the result (this is just to show how to access it later)
print(f'Task result: {result.get(timeout=10)}')
```
- Will see output on the worker 
```sh
[2024-11-26 23:52:05,768: INFO/MainProcess] Task celery_app.add[85152ea5-9b67-4773-be67-5ee77e25b179] received
[2024-11-26 23:52:05,768: INFO/ForkPoolWorker-8] Task celery_app.add[85152ea5-9b67-4773-be67-5ee77e25b179] succeeded in 4.975000047124922e-05s: 10
```

## Stopping RabbitMQ and Cleaning Up
If you’re done and want to stop and remove RabbitMQ:
```sh
docker stop rabbitmq
docker rm rabbitmq
```


### Troubleshooting
- RabbitMQ is not running: Ensure RabbitMQ is running by using systemctl status rabbitmq-server (on Linux) or checking the status in the management UI (localhost:15672).

- Connection Errors: If Celery cannot connect to RabbitMQ, make sure the broker URL in your celery_app.py is correct, and that RabbitMQ is running on the expected port (default is 5672).

- raise NotImplementedError(E_NO_BACKEND.strip())
result = add.apply_async((4, 6))  # Correct usage

This should resolve the TypeError and allow your task to be processed asynchronously by Celery.

The error you're seeing, NotImplementedError: E_NO_BACKEND.strip(), typically occurs in Celery when the result backend is not configured. Celery requires a result backend to store the results of tasks once they have completed, and if you don't specify a backend, it will raise this error.
What is the Result Backend?

The result backend is a system (such as a database, cache, or file system) where Celery can store the results of completed tasks. By default, Celery does not store task results unless you configure a backend.

How to Fix the Error

To fix this error, you need to configure a result backend in your Celery configuration. If you don't need to store task results, you can simply disable the result backend. If you need to store the results, you can use a backend like Redis, a database (SQLAlchemy, Django ORM), or even the same broker (RabbitMQ or Redis).
Option 1: Disable the Result Backend (If You Don’t Need Results)

If you don't need to store the results of your tasks (e.g., just fire-and-forget tasks), you can disable the result backend by setting result_backend = None.
Update celery_app.py:
```sh
from celery import Celery
```
Option 1: Use RabbitMQ as the message broker
```sh
app = Celery('tasks', broker='pyamqp://guest:guest@localhost//')
# Disable result backend
app.conf.result_backend = None
@app.task
def add(x, y):
    return x + y
```
Option 2: Use a Result Backend (Recommended for Storing Results)

If you want to store the results of tasks (e.g., for tracking or retry purposes), you need to specify a result backend. Commonly, you can use Redis or a database.
Example: Using Redis as the Result Backend

If you're using Redis as both the broker and the result backend, you can configure it like this:
```sh
from celery import Celery

# Use RabbitMQ as the message broker and Redis as the result backend
app = Celery('tasks', broker='pyamqp://guest:guest@localhost//', backend='redis://localhost:6379/0')

@app.task
def add(x, y):
    return x + y
```
Here:

    broker='pyamqp://guest:guest@localhost//': RabbitMQ is the broker (used for task distribution).
    backend='redis://localhost:6379/0': Redis is the result backend (used for storing results). This assumes that Redis is running locally on port 6379.

N.B: Make sure Redis is running if you're using it as the result backend. You can run Redis in Docker like this:
```sh
docker run -d -p 6379:6379 redis
```
Example: Using a Database as the Result Backend (SQLAlchemy)

If you're using a database like PostgreSQL or MySQL as the backend, you can use SQLAlchemy to connect Celery to the database.

First, install the required dependencies:
```sh
pip install celery[sqlalchemy]
```
Then, update the celery_app.py to configure the result backend to use SQLAlchemy:
```sh
from celery import Celery

# Use RabbitMQ as the message broker and SQLAlchemy as the result backend
app = Celery('tasks', broker='pyamqp://guest:guest@localhost//', backend='db+postgresql://user:password@localhost/mydatabase')

@app.task
def add(x, y):
    return x + y
```
In the above code, you would replace the postgresql://user:password@localhost/mydatabase part with your actual database connection string.

Option 3: Use the Default Backend (Same as Broker)

If you want to use the same broker (RabbitMQ or Redis) for both task communication and storing results, you can configure Celery like this:
Using Redis for Both Broker and Backend:
```sh
from celery import Celery

# Use Redis for both the broker and the result backend
app = Celery('tasks', broker='redis://localhost:6379/0', backend='redis://localhost:6379/0')

@app.task
def add(x, y):
    return x + y
```
Using RabbitMQ for Both Broker and Backend:

You can also configure RabbitMQ for both the broker and the result backend, though RabbitMQ is not often used for this purpose. For Redis or a database backend, it's more common, but here’s an example for RabbitMQ:
```sh
from celery import Celery

# Use RabbitMQ for both the broker and the result backend
app = Celery('tasks', broker='pyamqp://guest:guest@localhost//', backend='rpc://')

@app.task
def add(x, y):
    return x + y
```
**The rpc:// backend allows Celery to use RabbitMQ for storing task results**
