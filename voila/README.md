# Voila
Voilà transforms Jupyter Notebooks into standalone web applications, making it easy to share interactive data applications without exposing the underlying code. Adjust configurations according to your deployment needs for a seamless user experience.

## Steps
To deploy a Jupyter Notebook using Voilà, you'll need to follow these steps:
- python3 -m venv venv
- source venv/bin/activate
- pip install pandas numpy matplotlib scikit-learn voila ipywidgets
- test locally basics.ipynb
- voila basics.ipynb --port=8866 --no-browser --enable_nbextensions=True
This will start a local server. Open that URL http://localhost:8866 in your web browser to view the notebook rendered as a dashboard.

## Deploying to a Server
If you want to deploy Voilà on a cloud service or a server, here are a few options:
    Heroku: You can deploy a Voilà app on Heroku. You’ll need to create a Procfile and a requirements.txt to specify the dependencies.
    Binder: Use Binder to create a sharable link to your notebook that runs Voilà. You can set this up through the Binder website by linking to a GitHub repository containing your notebook.
    Docker: You can create a Docker container for your Voilà application, which makes it portable and easy to deploy on any server that supports Docker.
